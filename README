# why ?
# 
# I want to get some real-world experience of refactoring something completely
# out of my comfort range and distill it down to a nice lib, and of course,
# refactoring means lots of tests .. which I hope to get some feedback on.

# for building experience on:
#
# linux dev (in general)
# cmake, cdash, ctest
# eclipse
# gtk, gdk, cairo, et al.
# refactoring
# unit tests
# gcc
# doxygen
